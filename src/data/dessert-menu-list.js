    Ingredients: [
      "150g Dark Chocolate 65% x2\n",
      "150g Unsalted Butter\n",
      "65g Sugar/Dark Palm Sugar\n",
      "3 Eggs\n",
      "3 Yolk\n",
      "40g Plain Flour\n",
      "Salt\n",
      "50g Milk\n",
      "100g Cream\n",
      "25g Unsalted Butter\n",
      "90g Egg Whites\n",
      "180g Sugar\n",
      "50g Water\n",
    ],
    Recipe:
      "In a bowl, put 150g of dark chocolate, 150g of unsalted butter, 65g of sugar/dark palm sugar, and a sprinkle of salt and have it over a pot filled with boiling water. This will melt the chocolate and butter. " +
      "While that's melting, in another pot filled with 100g of cream add 50g of milk, then start heating it to a boil. Once it does boil, add 150g of dark chocolate, then blend it all together with a hand blender. " +
      "When the chocolate is nicely blended with the cream and milk, add 1Tbsp of unsalted butter into the mixture, and blend it again. Then pour some of the chocolate mixture into a cylinder mold, while leaving 1/4th of the chocolate mixture in another container to rest over night in the refrigerator. " +
      "The chocolate mixture in the mold is to be placed in the freezer over night. Going back to the original bowl of chocolate, check to make sure everything is melted. If the sugar is not melted, that's okay, it'll add some texture. " +
      "While stiring, add 3 eggs with 3 additional egg yolks one by one until the texture is a little thick. Then pour in 40g of flour and start mixing the batter together. Let it rest in the refrigerator for up to overnight. " +
      "Take a cylinder container that's heatable and wrap the bottom with aluminum foil and coat the inside of the cylinder with oil or butter. Then grab wax paper and create a wall against the inside of the cylinder. This will help take out the chocolate when it's done baking. " +
      "Pour the chocolate batter halfway in the cylinder. Then grab the frozen chocolate that was made earlier and place it perfectly in the center of the batter while also not too deep in it. " +
      "Then cover the rest of the cylinder with the remainder chocolate batter. Heat the chocolate in a 330°F over for 20 minutes. When the cake is done baking, out the over and then with a small knife run down the inside of the cylinder disconnecting it with the waxpaper. " +
      "Carefully remove the cylinder and the waxpaper, then place it on your plate. Hopefully, if everything worked out perfectly, the cake will retain it's shape and the molten chocolate will gush out immediately when cutting into it. Enjoy!",

      "frozen mochi balls in one by one. Fry them for about 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Make sure the mochi balls don't touch when frying. Once done frying, place them onto a paper towel to cool and they're done!",
