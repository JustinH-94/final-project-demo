        A little age never hurt anyone—unless we’re talking about our
        increasingly creaky knees and ever-more foggy memory, or
        sorer-by-the-day lower backs. Okay, scratch that. For us mortals, age
        hurts, period. But when it comes to such culinary delights as wine,
        cheese, and red meat, age has the power to enhance flavor and deepen our
        enjoyment. This is especially the case for dry-aged beef, which is known
        for a richer flavor and more tender texture—as well as a heftier price
        tag—than its fresh-cut counterparts. But what is it about dry-aging that
        works such magic on meat? Even if you appreciate what a dry-aged steak
        does for your tastebuds, the nuances about how it delivers such a
        transcendent experience may escape you. That’s why, with the help of
        food scientists and chefs, we’re unpacking exactly what dry-aged beef is
        and how dry-aging works.
        <p />
        “An unsexy way to explain it is that dry-aging, in a nutshell, is a
        controlled decay process,” says Katie Flannery, butcher and COO at
        Flannery Beef. “You’re exposing the subprimals to oxygen, which allows
        natural enzymes within the meat work,” she says. “They’re aerobic
        bacteria, so they need oxygen to survive. They come alive and start
        breaking down the molecular bonds of meat.” This, in turn, alters the
        flavor and texture of the cut. What dry aging looks like is literally a
        room full of moldy carcasses. In the dry-aging process, meat hangs in a
        humidity-controlled environment in a way that exposes all of its sides
        with unimpeded airflow around the entire cut. “Then there’s the good
        mold that finds its way onto steaks, which will slowly start to break
        down and increase the amount of evaporation,” says Chris Pandel,
        executive chef at Swift and Sons in Chicago. “You’re puling moisture
        from the meats over time. As that happens the mold will extend its life
        and grow. It’s like the mold on blue cheese—it’s good mold not bad
        mold.” Of course, before that slab of beef makes it to your plate, all
        of the mold will be trimmed away, leaving just “tenderized, funky,
        delicious meat,” Pandel says. He describes the flavor of dry-aged meat
        as having a nuttiness to it that you won’t get in a wet-aged steak.
        Likewise, it’ll be more tender and have a different mouthfeel.

        Moisture loss is one aspect that changes the flavor of dry-aged meat.
        “What that does is essentially concentrate the remainder of the tissue,”
        says Harold McGee, food scientist and author of Keys to Good Cooking: A
        Guide to Making the Best of Foods and Recipes. “Meat is about 75 percent
        water. If you lose a few percent to evaporation … what’s left will be
        more concentrated, so the flavor will be more concentrated.” For those
        who know their way around a kitchen, Flannery likens the process to
        reducing a stock to a demi-glaze. “You have that pot on your stovetop.
        As more and more moisture evaporates, the flavor of the liquid is
        getting more and more concentrated. With beef, as water evaporates, the
        natural beef flavor intensifies,” she says. But chemical changes also
        affect the flavor. “During the aging period, some of the flavor
        compounds and other molecules in the meat undergo chemical change that
        will increase some flavor components while reducing others,” says Joe
        Regenstein, Professor in the Department of Food Science at Cornell’s
        College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Muscle cells are made of lots
        of different materials, and chief among them are the proteins that
        enable the muscles to contract, and the molecules that fuel this
        process, such as glycogen, DNA and RNA. During dry-aging, these large,
        flavorless molecules are broken down into smaller, flavorful fragments,
        explains McGee. “All of those molecules are relatively large, and when
        they’re broken down by the enzyme activity, they form fragments that are
        more flavorful than the original large molecules,” he says. “Some
        proteins get broken down into amino acids. They can be a little bitter,
        savory, such as in MSG, and the DNA/RNA material can get broken into
        other molecules that are savory and enhance the savoriness of MSG. And
        glycogen broken into sugars which are sweet.” Dry aging transforms the
        texture of meat as well. “Meat has a very complex internal structure
        that can be difficult to bite through. By breaking some of these
        proteins down, the teeth can now more easily go through the meat,”
        <p />
        The ideal length of time for dry-aging meat really comes down to
        individual taste. For Flannery, the sweet spot is around 30 to 35 days.
        “For retail customers, we go 35 days, but for restaurant customers we go
        18 to 20,” she says. “That’s because in the restaurant industry, if a
        diner isn’t familiar with dry-aged beef, their first reaction might be
        to think that something is off.” Pandel says he likes meat that’s been
        aged around 45 days. “You can tell it’s been aged, but it’s not
        unpleasant,” he says. “We’ve gone further. In running a steakhouse it’s
        personal preference. Some folks like it really funky, but for some
        people it’s too gnarly.” And the longer you go, the funkier the flavor
        will get. “Dry-aged meat does have a unique smell and flavor. Funky is a
        good way to describe it,” she says. “It’s a more rich flavor up until
        the 30-day point. When you go farther than that, and if you go really
        far out, like 60 to 90 days, you develop a serious blue cheese funk to
        it. It will smell remarkably like blue cheese.”
