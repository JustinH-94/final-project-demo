        "Tempering is a term used in cooking when an ingredient—or two—needs to
        be stabilized, meaning its characteristics remain the same and aren't
        altered in any way. We see this technique used when combining
        ingredients that are each at completely different temperatures. In the
        kitchen, for instance, when a hot liquid like soup or stock is mixed
        directly with a cold item like cream or sour cream or eggs, the cold
        product will tend to curdle as the soup's heat coagulates the proteins
        in the dairy. Tempering is used to avoid this from happening. The
        tempering technique is also utilized when adding melted chocolate to
        other ingredients to prevent it from seizing. This should not be
        confused with the method of tempering chocolate in candy making;
        chocolate is tempered by heating and cooling and heating again to
        stabilize the fat in the chocolate, so it achieves a shiny appearance
        and doesn't crystallize or "bloom" once it cools.

        Tempering slowly increases—the keyword here being "slowly"—the heat of
        the cold ingredient so its temperature gradually rises and becomes more
        compatible with the temperature of the hot ingredient (which essentially
        slowly cools down when it comes in contact with the cold food). The
        shock of a cold ingredient suddenly turning hot can cook and change its
        composition, making it cook too quickly, curdle, seize, break, lump up,
        or split.

        Tempering is most often called for in a recipe when you are making a
        sauce, ice cream, custard, some cream soups, and recipes including sour
        cream. The general technique is to add a small amount of the hot liquid
        to the cold ingredient. This can be done by placing the cold item in a
        heatproof bowl and then briskly whisking in a few ladles of the hot
        ingredient and mixing or whisking until combined. Then you need to add
        the tempered mixture into the rest of the hot liquid. For example, if
        your recipe requires you to combine hot milk with eggs (like in a pastry
        cream), you need to slowly add a small amount of the hot milk to the
        eggs and whisk until combined. Then you will take this mixture and add
        it to the hot milk and whisk. (If you simply added the eggs to the hot
        milk you would end up with scrambled eggs in milk.) " - Barbara Rolek
