        Brining is the process of submerging a cut of meat in a brine solution,
        which is simply salt dissolved in water. The meat absorbs extra liquid
        and salt, resulting in a juicier and more flavorful final dish. This
        technique is particularly great for lean cuts of meat that tend to dry
        out during cooking! Basic brine ratio: The basic ratio of salt to water
        for a brine is 4 tablespoons of salt per 1 quart (4 cups) of water. In a
        container large enough to hold your meat (and preferably with a lid to
        avoid sloshing), dissolve the salt in the water. Add your meat. If
        there’s not quite enough liquid to cover, add a solution of 1 cup of
        water and 1 tablespoon of salt until the meat is completely submerged.
        Cover the container and refrigerate. Since it’s so large, a turkey
        ideally needs to be brined overnight—for about 12 hours. Smaller cuts
        like pork chops or chicken breast for weeknight dinners take far less
        time and are typically ready to be cooked in 1/2 hour to an hour. To
        infuse your meat with extra flavor, throw some extra spices and
        aromatics into your brine that will complement the finished dish. Making
        our Pork Stir-fry with Asparagus and Sugar Snap Peas? Try adding a few
        slivers of ginger into the brine. For roasted chickens, add lemon rind
        and a few sprigs of rosemary or thyme. Some folks also like adding sugar
        (about 2 tablespoons per quart) into the brine to lightly sweeten the
        meat. One quick note: brining is really more of a technique for dry heat
        preparations like roasting and grilling. The flavor and texture
        difference isn’t as great when braising and poaching in liquid.
