        Sous vide. It sounds more intense than it is. The name conjures thoughts
        of scientists, draped in white lab coats or disgraced cooking
        competition show contestants, cowering in front of disappointed judges.
        Is it science-y? Sure it is. And do professional chefs use them for
        impressive, perfectly-cooked proteins? Yup. But what is sous vide,
        really? At its most fundamental level, sous vide cooking is the process
        of sealing food in an airtight container—usually a vacuum sealed bag—and
        then cooking that food in temperature-controlled water. In French, the
        term translates to "under vacuum," which makes sense. Chefs vacuum seal
        a protein with marinade, sauce, herbs, or spices and drop it in a large
        pot of water. There’s no contact with a heated metal surface. No contact
        with flames or steam or smoke. The water never comes to a boil. Yeah,
        it's pretty low-key. A sous vide machine uses a heated metal coil to
        warm water to a constant temperature, never fluctuating to high or low
        extremes. This means that the cooking progress is gradual and
        controlled. Proteins like steak, pork, chicken, and fish cook for
        elongated periods of time, slowly heating up until the entire piece of
        protein reaches the temperature of the water. Since the water never goes
        past the desired temperature of doneness, the meat takes significantly
        longer to cook (A 12 oz. NY strip takes a little over two hours), but it
        also means that you’ll never have an overcooked piece of protein.
        <p />
        <p /> When that same steak is cooked on the stove, high, direct heat is
        applied to the meat to bring the internal temperature up to 135°. While
        that's happening, you can't see what's actually going on inside, which
        means you either have to guess, cut it open (which ruins the whole
        presentation), or poke it anxiously with a meat thermometer. With sous
        vide, there's no guess work. If you put a steak in a bath set at 140°,
        there's no chance that steak will go past that temperature. The steak is
        cooked to a perfect medium-rare throughout, and that's thanks to the
        sous vide's secondary function, water circulation. Constantly moving
        water ensures that there are no hot or cool spots in your pot. It’s an
        insurance policy, like some kind of perfectly-heated, dinner-making
        jacuzzi. The only hands-on part of the ordeal happens after the food is
        removed from the bag. Since the sous vide process removes actual contact
        with a surface from the equation, the meat won’t be crispy, caramelized,
        or charred in any way. When cooking proteins like pork or steak (which
        will look pretty gray after a sous vide bath), that exterior texture is
        key. The solution? An extremely quick sear after the meat has been
        cooked through. Searing steak or pork in a ripping-hot cast iron skillet
        for about a minute on each side (including the smaller sides) will
        develop some caramelization without cooking the interior any further.

        And this is the reason why restaurants love sous vide cooking. Being
        able to cook thick ribeye steaks to a perfect medium-rare before dinner
        service starts is a huge help. While a chef would normally spend about
        an hour cooking a ribeye from start to finish (letting it come to
        temperature, cooking it in a skillet, letting it rest, slicing it, and
        plating it), the sous vide method shaves off time by allowing the chef
        to unwrap the steak and quickly sear, slice, and serve, all while
        guaranteeing the right interior doneness. Sous vide used to be a method
        employed solely by restaurants, using extremely expensive, large
        machines to cook in large quantities. But that was then, and this is
        now. We're living in the golden age of at-home sous vide cooking, with
        small, affordable, powerful sous vide machines like the Joule warming
        the waters for home cooks for around $100 dollars a pop. In fact, some
        would say sous vide is more efficient at home than in a professional
        kitchen, feeding hundreds of people. But before you run out to buy one
        (or, let’s be honest, click three times on your laptop), let's talk
        about why you should. Having pre-cooked, vacuum-sealed proteins at your
        disposal makes dinner a hell of a lot easier. Maybe you're hosting a
        dinner party and don't have the time to dedicate to 12 pork chops. Sous
        vide them before hand, and sear them up right before dinner is served
        (this cuts down on smoke too.). But what if it's just you? Still worth
        it?
        <p />

        Sous vide is supremely useful in meal prep situations for lazy weeknight
        dinners. Since your protein is sealed (assuming you used a vacuum
        sealer, like our personal favorite) and cooked through, it will last in
        the fridge for at least a week. Once your meat comes to room
        temperature, you’re a quick-sear away from an impressive Wednesday night
        dinner. Less of a mess. Less time spent standing over a stove. Less
        stress, in general. If you have a problem with that, well, we can’t
        really help you. Sous vide also protects and improves your purchases.
        The sous vide process guarantees that you won’t overcook a piece of
        meat. That’s huge, especially when you’ve spent a solid chunk of change
        on an impressive cut. But it also allows the cheaper cuts to become
        tender. Steaks with a traditionally tough reputation, like a tri-tip or
        chuck, do wonderfully in the sous vide. When you cook them using a
        traditional method, the muscle fibers contract rapidly, forcing out the
        moisture inside of the meat. With sous vide, those same fibers contract
        slowly, allowing the juice to stay inside of the meat. This gives you a
        tri-tip that eats more like a steak three times its price. And while we
        obviously love a sous vide machine for proteins, there's more to
        explore. Chefs love sous vide eggs, for perfectly-set whites and runny
        yolks. Potatoes cook especially well (sous vide potato salad is
        amazing), and tender vegetables like asparagus are easily cooked for
        salads or sides. The sous vide doesn't discriminate.
